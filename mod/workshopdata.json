At the moment there are little major gameplay changes, but there is a lot of new art to rediscover!\r\n\r\n[h1] Content in this mod includes: [/h1]\r\n[list][*] New DMS skins (\u002B a template)\r\n[*] New cutscenes / menu art\r\n[*] Options to enable / disable certain aspects of the mod\r\n[*] Revamped story points[/list]\r\n\r\n[h2] Acknowledgements for patch 1.1.0: [/h2]\r\n[list][*] Arti\u0027s custom scar sprites cannot be interchanged like the normal scar, instead it is separated into it\u0027s own category for future support.\r\n[*] Spearmaster\u0027s graphics are not fully completed, some physics scenarios may not be accounted for and may change in the future.\r\n[*] Half of the art was made half a year ago, and may not reflect the quality standard I now have in mind, but the general emotional tone remains the same.\r\n[*] I did all of this by myself, with outside advice only for figuring out how to code in the first place.[/list]",
