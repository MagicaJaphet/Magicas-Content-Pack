How curious! There's no text on here for me to read to you. Rather, this pearl has an audio track within it.

Back when I participated in Iterator conversation groups, there were some out there who<LINE>had a great interest in cultural archiving. I would have loved to share this with them.

But for me and you, I'm afraid there's little of value to be found here.
