SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM04, FP_ROOT

BSM: I have not seen Ruffles in a fair few cycles, my overseers have not reported any sighting of them either.<LINE>Have you any idea where theyâ€™ve gone?

FP: Actually, they paid me a visit.

BSM: Oh! How was it? Where did they head after?

FP: They have taken into the habit of making their visits solely to listen to the music piece I like to replay.

FP: They left through the access shaft with an impressive display of acrobatics.

BSM: A music piece? If I were a single-brained organism, I believe I too would be fascinated.

BSM: Ah, so then I presume they must be somewhere around the chimney stacks! I will try to direct my wild overseers that way.

FP: You'll find their natural migration path to be more predictable. My inner structure has become far too<LINE>hazardous to venture.

FP: I can share the sound data of this hymn to you, too.
