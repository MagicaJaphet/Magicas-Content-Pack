SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM04, FP_ROOT

BSM: Why would Suns be calling anyone of us a bug?

BSM: I don’t recall with complete certainty, but were they not built to preserve some of the last natural flora?

FP: Indeed, but I don’t know if that information is relevant.

FP: What mattered to me is I was being considered a pawn, by my own role model no less, and that this whole Big Task was<LINE>nothing more than a cruel joke by the long passed benefactors I hadn’t the chance to know.

BSM: I never thought of the task like that, neither had I spoken much to Suns on a personal level since the wider populace of us increased.

BSM: I had always found purpose in seeking truth, and nothing more. If my research could bring peace to the lost and writhing world,<LINE>then it was enough.

BSM: The answer did not always have to pertain to the Question itself.

FP: I can see my error clearly now.

FP: Even then, I will not try to justify my actions.

BSM: I understand you’re only trying to explain it. And I care to hear your side too.
