[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: Do you suppose you’d ever raise a normal messenger?

NSH: “Normal”, do we have to go over my definition of normal again?

SRS: No, I figured that if my messenger ever does return, they may seek the company of their own kind eventually.

NSH: ... Well, when you put it like that. After I manufacture our last ditch effort here, I don’t see why not.

NSH: Especially when our equipment starts eroding and I can’t bother you in this way anymore, I’ll have to start bothering you another way!

SRS: I’d appreciate that, honestly. How’s the progress on your crack in going?

NSH: I’m actually getting close, only a few more backdoor commands and permissions I totally have legal authority to.

NSH: What are you going to do now? Besides thinking about the consequences of everyone’s actions.

SRS: ... I believe I’ve been coming up with a few things to do.

SRS: For now, I need to write someone an apology.
