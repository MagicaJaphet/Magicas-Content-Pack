[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: To be honest, I’m not sure. The most I can do is hope my messenger is alright.

SRS: A lot of my effort was put into this singular plan. With the diminishing time, I’m afraid there’s little more I can do.

NSH: Can you try to observe the area around the facility for me at least while I’m putting together my own plan?

NSH: I’m growing more and more concerned for Moon, now that we can’t exactly monitor her activity with accuracy.

SRS: Of course. I have a few backup overseers around the area.

NSH: Thanks.

NSH: ... Even though I’m well aware we are ALL stuck in these boxes, our minds and bodies.

NSH: I can’t help but give into that hopeless feeling. It’s like watching the worst possible outcome unfurl with no way to slow or stop it.

SRS: ... I never expected it to come to this, either.
