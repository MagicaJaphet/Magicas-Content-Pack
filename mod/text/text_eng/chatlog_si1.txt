[REFLECTED MESSAGE]

NSH: Five Pebbles, you have to stop. This is not a matter of enlightenment, this is a matter of siblicide.

NSH: You’re going to ignore us, but. When you eventually break out of this phase, you’re going to deeply regret this.

NSH: Look back on this message and know we did all we could.

NSH: We were your friends, too.  By the time you remember that, our ability to communicate will be gone.
