[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: What I don’t comprehend... Why hasn’t Moon done anything for herself? Has she no self-preservation?

SRS: She was appointed our senior for this very purpose. To keep erratic behavior under control for more than our sakes.

SRS: The toll this will take on their facility grounds will be catastrophic.

NSH: Coming from her close friend, I can tell you she does care about everything.

NSH: And while her consideration is one of her greatest attributes, it is also to her detriment.

NSH: I wish I knew exactly what logical conclusion she came to, but I can assume it has to do with that fault.

NSH: Authority does not always follow the mentality of absolute respect. We all saw the forced broadcast. It’s heartbreaking.

SRS: ... As I’m about Moon’s age,  I am a tad disappointed in her personal growth.
