This is... written by me? I'm afraid I do not recall ever writing this, <PLAYERNAME>.

It appears to be... a message to my neighbor. You surely have crossed his unfortunate state by now.

He used to stand tall above my collapsed state, for reasons that only mattered to us as we were<LINE>in the past. Those cycles have long passed now.

For a long while I'll admit I held a small amount of resentment, being drowned in the rain<LINE>he produced in attempts to fix his own mistakes. But as it is now, I've come to understand why he tried to<LINE>do what he did.

We were all frustrated that we could not find the answer our creators trusted so deeply in<LINE>us to find for your sort, <PLAYERNAME>. The most we could do at any given point was to point you in the<LINE>general direction of the closest void reserve.

For some, it felt as though by being born we were set up for failure. Five Pebbles trusted<LINE>all of us to guide him as he was one of the youngest of us.

I'm not sure entirely what shifted, or if he was in good hands at the time... but I know his<LINE>actions now were a perverse attempt to lift a non existant burden off of me.

Since we were neighbors, and such a thing is rather unheard of, he confided in me before his<LINE>collapse the true reason for his hasty and taboo actions.

0 : ... Even if he never told me... I still had forgiven him a long ago. : 60

If only he could know now. I did my best to reassure him, knowing the inevitable...

<PLAYERNAME>... would it be too much of me to ask an attuned one to do me a small favor?

If you plan to go back for any reason... please, take this pearl with you.

Even if you do not make it, the thought is enough to put me at peace.

I suppose this is a sign we may meet again.

Good luck.
