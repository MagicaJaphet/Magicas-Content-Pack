[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: Any word from Five Pebbles or Moon?

SRS: No, not a word. I still haven't heard anything since he destroyed my overseer.

NSH: I was working my way there already, I found a work around for the lockdown.

SRS: And that's why I put my faith in you. Thank you.

NSH: Hopefully they'll make it in time, I wonder how your little messenger is.

SRS: They're likely worried, I imagine... They do not venture far without my overseer.

SRS: It's why I reinforced it from the usual troubles our overseers face out in the wild.

NSH: Very clever! I always keep my overseers on high guard regardless. I have plenty of those scavengers to worry about.

SRS: Despite the thriving landscape, they don't appear to have migrated to my premises much yet.

SRS: I'm sure that's to change with time.

NSH: Haha.

NSH: ... What should I do if I make it there and the messenger is gone?

SRS: ...

SRS: Keep Moon company before she's gone.
