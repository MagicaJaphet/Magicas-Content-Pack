SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM02, FP_ROOT

BSM: Do you believe after all of us are gone, we too will be reborn into the next cycle?

FP: I do not know, even if we contain pieces of our citizens in our memory bases I cannot say it constitues us of being. We are by nature still tied into the cycle, so perhaps in the next we will become their machines.

BSM: Hopefully not so grounded in their problems. Yet, in our throws I've discovered lots of things about void fluid and the world they would have loved to know! I wonder if Ruffles ever understood my ramblings.

FP: I still wonder where they obtained their mark. It was not of us.

BSM: Indeed.

BSM: My lifespan is far greater than any organism on this planet besides the rocks and gas… For some reason I cannot believe how short theirs was.

BSM: I miss them a lot.

FP: Their children have little interest in us compared to them. It is unfortunate to see, but as is the way of life.

FP: If there is anyone to rely on staying, at least for now… You can rely on me.

BSM: Talking about them helps ease the sting.

FP: Would you care to theorize what they will reincarnate into?

BSM: Yes, I'd love to.
