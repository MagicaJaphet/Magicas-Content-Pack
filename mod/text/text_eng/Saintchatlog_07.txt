SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM04, FP_ROOT

BSM: Ruffles has been visiting frequently over the past few cycles! They started bringing me a variety of local flora,<LINE>perhaps to show that they consider me one of their kind?

FP: How thoughtful of them. What sort of specimens have they brought so far?

BSM: Mostly small pieces of the aquatic variation that sprout close to my structure. They've been present even before my collapse.

BSM: Though there is this specific one, it seems to be from further out in our facility grounds! Oh, I wonder how far<LINE>the wet companion had to traverse to find this!

FP: My database has been scrambled too far to conclusively say, but this appears to originate around the west side.<LINE>Which is relatively far.

FP: The lengths this companion will go is a good sign of it's loyalty.

BSM: Really? I never had a purposed organism like Sig did in the height of his personal projects. I partially recall<LINE>bits of data he would pass onto me about them.

FP: I gained a fair bit of knowledge from Suns, myself.
