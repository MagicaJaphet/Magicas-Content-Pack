[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment
NSH: Since I have nothing else to do with my time, I need to start looking into a way to send a new messenger to Moon.
NSH: How did you manage to get yours in with Five Pebbles on lockdown already?
SRS: It was quite simple, I traced where creatures would choose to slip in and used the one with the best success rate.
SRS: I did equip my messenger with the means in mind to get there, it does require a bit of climbing.
SRS: Best way to teach a messenger to climb is to give them the means to make it easier.
NSH: I see... Could you send the directions from your facility? It'd be faster to work off what's already established.
SRS: Of course, I trust you with that sort of sensitive information.
NSH: Thanks. I'm a little pressed on time to manufacture a messenger like this.
NSH: You make it look so easy, mingling two different organisms like that.
SRS: Flora and fauna are not so different to me.
