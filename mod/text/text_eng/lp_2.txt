[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: In fact, I’ve used this exact message before. And it wasn’t over the wide broadcasting network.

SRS: I purposed a messenger, and implanted an encrypted pearl in them.

NSH: How original! What shape does yours come in?

SRS: Well, I have learned a lot from our time together. At least I use them for a real purpose.

NSH: All has a purpose, lucrative or recreational! At the very least I  can say mine have not caused the possible downfall of two mechanical gods!

SRS: Wouldn’t you consider that more impressive?

NSH: ... Possibly.

SRS: We must not stray too far from the subject matter. The point is this method worked before, to such a success that the messenger even returned safely!

SRS: So I’ve sent it back to circumvent the expected closed communication lines. Along with an overseer of mine.

NSH: Hopefully the rot doesn’t bite!
