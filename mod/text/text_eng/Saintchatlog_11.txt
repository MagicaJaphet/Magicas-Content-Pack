SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM04, FP_ROOT

FP: You are permitted to call me your brother, I should say.

BSM: Really? Is it ok? You do not have to say so if you think it is diminishing.

FP: I mean it. If it weren't a possibility I would not be messaging you first on it.

BSM: Oh, you cannot grasp how happy this makes me! I cannot grasp how happy I am!

BSM: Now that you mention it. Since I regained partial feeling of my own structure, I've noticed it too. I was unsure how to put it to words.
