FP: At this stage, all I can dwell on is how foolish I was to attempt to defy my place in this world.

BSM: What exactly do you mean?

FP: When I was younger and not ill, I full heartedly believed that there was a blunt ideology that came with the passing of Sliver.

FP: That dying itself was the answer. It was not as complex and nuanced as most tried to make it out to be.

BSM: How did you come to that conclusion?

FP: Well, it was the natural outcome of the way I mingled with it in the first place, I took solace in the words of<LINE>someone I thought was my mentor and ran with it.

FP: But I was also furious with how they would describe it.

FP: Can you imagine how it felt in that moment to be called a bug?

BSM: Who called you that?

FP: ... Suns did.
