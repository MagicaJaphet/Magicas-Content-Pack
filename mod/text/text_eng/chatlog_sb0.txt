[RECORDED BROADCAST : 1681.663] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, Chasing Wind

SRS: What has Moon been doing? This is incredibly negligent of her senior duties.

CW: We don’t know, Suns. It’s not looking good, considering the two are connected by that bridge.

CW: Is Five Pebbles responding? I’ve been scolding Unparalleled Innocence for a while, but there’s little anyone can do to repair Five Pebble’s reputation with this outlook.

SRS: No, it appears he may have been shunned into hiding. If he isn’t even willing to listen to me, I’m afraid we’ll all have to start considering more drastic measures.

CW: As much as I wish I could contribute, I have my own structural integrity to worry about. Cheers, Suns.

SRS: Thank you Chasing WInd. Cheers.
