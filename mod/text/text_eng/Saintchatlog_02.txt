SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM04, FP_ROOT

FP: The past is unchangeable now, though. I don’t think dwelling on it will be productive.

BSM: Of course, but I wonder how long it’s been...

BSM: We can no longer reach the others, it seems. I most definitely cannot in my state.

BSM: But I received proof that they still remember us. If it weren’t for that red messenger...

FP: I attempted to help it so I’d be sure it reached you. Even though I could not tend to my own illness, the trial and error I’d gone through bought it a little more time.

FP: And even now, I willingly gave up my remaining rarefaction cell too. It puts me at ease to know the wet mouse was capable as well.

BSM: I’m... so taken aback by your actions, Pebbles.

BSM: I knew deep in my soul there was always good in us all, and my dedication to preserving the dwindling kindness would eventually pay off.

FP: ...

FP: The guilt is killing me.
