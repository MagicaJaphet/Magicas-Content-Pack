[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: I've lost track of the messenger, Suns.

SRS: Where have they gone? Where was the last place you saw them?

NSH: They were on the right track, but all of the sudden they started heading further down.

SRS: ...

SRS: Then it seems the little messenger will not be returning after all.

NSH: At least they served their purpose, right?

SRS: They... all of my creatures are more than a purpose, despite it being in their name.

SRS: I was already thinking of names, even though I knew I shouldn't.

NSH: I won't scold you for it, afterall it's in our nature to calculate every outcome.

NSH: This is merely another outcome.

SRS: Is it wrong I feel the desire to detest it? We are made to lead these creatures to enlightment.

NSH: ... No.

NSH: We are far from flawless machines.
