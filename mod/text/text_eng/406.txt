My overseers have reported that you passed something along to my neighbor, Moon.

Yet still, why do you insist to return here? Are you not aware you are dying as we speak little creature?

30 : ... If that's how it is. : 60

I understand the position you're in, we are quite similar. I am also plagued with an unfortunate growth.

But you will not last, while I will remain for many more cycles much to my dismay. I cannot say if I too will wake as most organisms do<LINE>but I desire to help you reach inner peace, little creature.

If you come here sooner I can grant you a small peace of mind. It is no panacea however. 

When you find the chance take the path west past the Farm Arrays, and then down into the earth where the land fissures, as deep as you<LINE>can reach, where the ancients built their temples and danced their silly rituals.

Beneath the earth is your salvation little creature.

I do not desire to see another in my position feel trapped.

Thank you for helping us, small one.

Your journey has not been in vain.
