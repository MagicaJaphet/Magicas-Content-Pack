[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: I’m actually getting worked up over this, to be honest.

SRS: Why is that?

NSH: None of my messages have gone through to Moon at all. She’s a very close friend, and the sudden disconnect from the network has even this comedian feeling down...

NSH: It’s not like her to act like this, I fear this situation really is as dire as the others are making it out to be.

SRS: Then this is the time to act, Sig. If you worry more than you take action, nothing will ever clear itself up.

SRS: This is exactly why I’ve sent the messenger.

NSH: You do make a great point, Suns.

NSH: I’ve been trying to keep others hopes up by joking in the public chat, but I should start preparing a back up plan if things worsen.
