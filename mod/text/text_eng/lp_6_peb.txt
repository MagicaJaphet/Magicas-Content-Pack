[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: I recall approaching Five Pebbles not too long after his constructors flipped his switch. He was rebellious, even then.

SRS: It was an odd situation, as you are well aware. To be built next to another iterator is rare, and the other to be made senior of the local group is unheard of. Moon was so quickly eager to accept the self-imposed title of “Sister”.

NSH: What makes you disappointed in Moon’s growth? She’s doing her best in a terrible situation. Five Pebbles lacks appreciation and respect!

SRS: He does, however, his creators should have expected from their own kind that one in their image would strive from independence from authority. We are not made to enjoy our cages.

NSH: Still I’d argue if Moon is lacking in development, then so has Five Pebbles failed to prove his own!

SRS: That is... very true. I will not refute your argument. The situation is far too complicated to comment on.

NSH: You’re going to have to reconfigure your mentor tactics, Suns. If this is a cataclysm caused by your private matters, their lack of development is now partially your doing.

SRS: ... Perhaps then, I’ll dedicate my time to that too.
