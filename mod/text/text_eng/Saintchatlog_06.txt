[DIRECT BROADCAST] PRIVATE - Big Sister Moon, Five Pebbles

SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM04, FP_ROOT

BSM: I’ve come to terms with it all, as well. I hold no ill thoughts towards you anymore nor have I for hundreds of cycles, Pebbles.

BSM: You are dying, so let us move on from the past. I want to cherish you now! Now that you are communicating with me again.

BSM: Does speaking ease the pain at all?

FP: It only serves as a distraction. It is not a medicine, still I will accept it as it’s the only thing I have left. Is the wet mouse with you?

BSM: Ah! Yes, they have been with me for some time now! They fell asleep not long after returning to my chamber.

BSM: I’ve actually been considering naming it, as foolish as it seems.

FP: Ah? With our lack of company and dwindling purpose, I see nothing wrong in it.

FP: There used to be one I’d refer to as The Ruffian, due to their violent nature and also as they somehow managed to obtain a lost citizen’s ID drone.

BSM: Wow! In that case, perhaps I could find a similar name as a homage to them. If that is alright of course.

FP: If they were still here, they would be honored.
