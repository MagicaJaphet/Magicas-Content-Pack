[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: Just curious, how did you teach a creature to communicate without a mark?

SRS: Simple, I borrowed a language from the late period of the Yellow hegemonic dynasty. It used gestures and facial expressions as a silent method of communication with the seriously ill.

SRS: The version I use, however, was developed and modified in the early Rarefied era after the void fluid revolution. It’s finely archived, and works even with the lack of faces.

NSH: Interesting! I was never too much involved in older history like that, I’m more invested in older scientific methods.

NSH: Was there a reason you embedded the pearl in the messenger’s chest? You are aware that those distant pipe cleaner organisms are made with an internal sac to store small objects in for this very thing.

SRS: The blueprint I used was not fully composed of just one organism. The sac had to be removed along with a few other organs to make room for their main means of offense and traversal.

NSH: ... I definitely don’t have time to put together something as elaborate as that.
