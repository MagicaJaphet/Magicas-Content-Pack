[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: Any word from Five Pebbles or Moon?

SRS: No, not a word. I still haven't heard anything since he destroyed my overseer.

NSH: I was working my way there already, I found a work around for the lockdown.

SRS: And that's why I put my faith in you. Thank you.

NSH: Hopefully they'll make it in time, I wonder how your little messenger is.

SRS: They're likely worried, I imagine... They do not venture far without my overseer.

SRS: It's why I reinforced it from the usual troubles our overseers face out in the wild.
