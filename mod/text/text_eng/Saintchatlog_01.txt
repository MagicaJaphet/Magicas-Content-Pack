SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM04, FP_ROOT

BSM: How long has it been since you contacted the others?

FP: ...

FP: Not since the incident that left us here to begin with.

FP: How could I possibly face the others like this? I could not even rectify my mistake.

BSM: It's alright.

BSM: We both suffered, but that's not of any importance to me anymore.

BSM: I'm sure despite all of that, the others still would have forgiven you.

BSM: What use would they have in holding spite in our efforts to absolve ourselves of it?

FP: Some of them had reasons.
