How strange! This pearl is still warm, as if its data was accessed very recently.

Unfortunately, there's no text on here for me to read to you. Rather, this pearl has an audio track within it.

Back when I participated in Iterator conversation groups, there were some out there who<LINE>had a great interest in cultural archiving. I would have loved to share this with them.

But for me and you, I'm afraid there's little of value to be found here.
