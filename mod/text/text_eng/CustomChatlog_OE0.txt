SRS: I see them! I see my messenger!
NSH: Seems they did Moon a favor, too.

NSH: The tides are turning, looks like your little messenger will come back after all.
NSH: It's time to repay Moon for all her kindness, don't you think?
SRS: ... I agree. I feel as though I've failed her, it's the least we can do to ammend this.

SRS: Thank you.
SRS: I'm going to start considering a name for my messenger.
