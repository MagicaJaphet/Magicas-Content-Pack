[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

NSH: Let’s move to a lighter topic, arguing moralities is not going to advance our solution any further.

NSH: I figure I will have to resort to giving my own care package the mark in order to make this faster. How much from your experience has the mark helped you in your journey of experiments?

SRS: Not much, the mark does guide lesser creatures closer to their own spiritual enlightenment, but it doesn’t always carry a full effect. 

SRS: The linguistic cognizance it gives as a side effect is enough to translate some information. It does not make the creature more sapient than they started, however.

SRS: I found in my own study, and with the messenger I purposed for this mission that reinforcing language was more effective than taking the shortcut. They do not even possess the mark.

NSH: Interesting! For my own intents and purposes, I only need it to understand a simple goal. When I get my overseer to Moon, I’ll look more into what it’ll need to do specifically.

NSH: I’m afraid it won’t have a lot of time to receive reinforcing like yours has, I’m sure.

SRS: Haha, my messengers are more worthy of praise than your previous fiascos. But do be sure to give it a bit of your love.
