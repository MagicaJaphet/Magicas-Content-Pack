This one contains an encoded hymn. Where did you find this? It must have been buried deep within the memory crypts, this pearl is considered holy property.
... I've not seen one of these since my inhabitants departed, and to find it in such quality! Fascinating... A little creature like you could not comprehend<LINE>the complex symbolism hidden in the pitched disonance within this crystaline prison, but it served an important purpose to my citizens.
This hymn in particular served as a piece proposing the idea that music could be used as a way ease oneself on their journey to abate themselves of their<LINE>natural urges.
It was made in a way to highlight the ebbing and flowing of the cycle as the sky falls and the earth rises. Steady, slowly sinking as it approaches oblivion,<LINE>but written in such a way that it was calming. This is not the only one I recall, but this is the first that has come into my possession since they took<LINE>their leave.
