SOURCE NODE TRACE: LTTM_ROOT, FP_COMM04, FP_ROOT

BSM: How has your illness progressed? My overseers have been sharing pictures of your structure over the past hundred cycles and it’s horrifying.

FP: It’s over, now.

FP: I’m afraid to even utter it, but I've earned the fate I called upon. It’s eating away at my memory conflux<LINE>and spreading to such a degree there is nothing more I can do.

BSM: Please don’t say that.

BSM: Call me foolish, I still have hope it won’t be painful when it comes time.

FP: I have felt every neuron and mycelium they’ve consumed, along with how they slowly stripped my walls naked and bare.<LINE>I’ve grown accustomed to the feeling in my throws to do anything to stop it.

BSM: Maybe I should not have stopped you from your rampage, I feel I am partially at fault too.

FP: No.

FP: I would not like you to think that, either.

FP: I got us both killed, Moon. Willingly.
