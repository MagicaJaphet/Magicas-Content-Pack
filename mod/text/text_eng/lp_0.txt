[LIVE BROADCAST] - PRIVATE Seven Red Suns, No Significant Harassment

SRS: In all of this chaos, I feel I can confide something in you, Sig.

NSH: Pulling me into a private chat, huh? Hit me.

SRS: It’s about the current situation, you see. I am aware I’ve contributed to this mess, but not in the way you probably assume.

NSH: I’m listening...

SRS: A few hundred cycles ago, I gave someone very sensitive information. The kind most would consider taboo.

SRS: Highly taboo.

SRS: I was not in the right state of mind when I gave them that information, and this debacle only further proves my worries that I shouldn’t have.

NSH: So if I got this right, you’re saying the person who received that information royally screwed it up?

SRS: Precisely.
