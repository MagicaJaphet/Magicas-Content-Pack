# Magica's Content Pack
A downpour-focused expansion which focuses on filling out the DLC and parts of base game with extra missing content which felt necessary to make. Started simply with replacing artificer scenes, which grew into a need to code in tracking of the artificer's dreams, turned into this project.

Feel free to reference for your own Rain World projects, though be advised my methods may be more insane than others and some code may not reflect my current level of skill. Passion project since late 2023.

## What's all in the mod? (Planned anyway)
- [Dress My Slugcat] Skins in my art style and support for custom sprites
- Altered designs for all of the slugcats based more closely on my anthro slugcat designs
- Gameplay changes to mostly downpour slugcats to fit the flow of the original game better
- Changes lore and characterizations of certain things that downpour added to be more vanilla compatible
- Adds a few new regions, possibly altering a few exisiting ones as well
- Adds more interactions with the iterators based on specific actions performed, in attempt to make the game feel more immersive
